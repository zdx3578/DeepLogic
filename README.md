Abstract—
Neural-symbolic learning, aiming to combine the perceiving power of neural perception and the reasoning power of symbolic
logic together, has drawn increasing research attention. However, existing works simply cascade the two components together and
optimize them isolatedly, failing to utilize the mutual enhancing information between them. To address this problem, we propose
DeepLogic, a framework with joint learning of neural perception and logical reasoning, such that these two components are jointly
optimized through mutual supervision signals. In particular, the proposed DeepLogic framework contains a deep-logic module that is
capable of representing complex first-order-logic formulas in a tree structure with basic logic operators. We then theoretically quantify the
mutual supervision signals and propose the deep&logic optimization algorithm for joint optimization. We further prove the convergence of
DeepLogic and conduct extensive experiments on model performance, convergence, and generalization, as well as its extension to the
continuous domain. The experimental results show that through jointly learning both perceptual ability and logic formulas in a weakly
supervised manner, our proposed DeepLogic framework can significantly outperform DNN-based baselines by a great margin and beat
other strong baselines without out-of-box tools.
